# ADECOMP: Stata module to estimate Shapley Decomposition by Components of a Welfare Measure



## Abstract

adecomp implements the shapley decomposition of changes in a welfare indicator as proposed by Azevedo, Sanfelice and Nguyen (2012). Following Barros et al. (2006), this method takes advantage of the additivity property of a welfare aggregate to construct a counterfactual unconditional distribution of the welfare aggregate by changing each component at a time to calculate their contribution to the observed changes in poverty, inequality and the growth incidence curve. This method can be applied in the context of both repeated cross-section surveys and longitudinal surveys, however the interpretation of the results will change as discussed by Azevedo, Sanfelice and Nguyen (2012).
